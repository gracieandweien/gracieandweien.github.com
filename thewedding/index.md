##The Wedding

Gracie and Weien are getting married on March 22, 2013 at 4 pm at the [United Methodist Church of New Lenox](http://www.umcnl.com/37993.html), located at 339 New Lenox Road, New Lenox IL, 60451. Come ready to stand up and sit down in your Sunday best! 8D (OKAY not sure what all else to put here).

##Getting There

If you're arriving via Route 30, the entrance to the property kind of sneaks up on ya! Look for two lamp posts in front of a copse of trees. If you're heading toward the church from I-80, the entrance is after the Pizza Hut, but if you pass El Burrito Loco, then you've gone too far.
